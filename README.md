It would be best to add a screenshot of the code's textmate scope. You can do this by:

1. Press F1 or Ctrl + Shift + P
2. Search for "token"
3. Click "Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes"
4. Select the field where the color is not right and take a screenshot of the pop-up box allong with the code.
